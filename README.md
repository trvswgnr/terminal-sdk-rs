# Rust API client for [Terminal Products, Inc](https://terminal.shop)

Unofficial Rust API client for the [Terminal API](https://www.terminal.shop/api).

The Terminal API gives you access to the same API that powers the award winning Terminal SSH shop (`ssh terminal.shop`).

## Installation

Clone this repo into your project folder and add the following to `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```
terminal = { path = "./terminal-sdk-rs" }
```

## Using the Client

This SDK provides a convenient `Client` struct with methods for all API endpoints. The client is auto-generated at build time using the `build.rs` script, which parses all API modules and creates wrapper methods.

### Creating a client

```rust
use terminal;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = terminal::Client::default();
    let result = client.get_product().await;
    println!("{:?}", result);
}
```

The client provides methods for all API endpoints with proper type checking and documentation.
